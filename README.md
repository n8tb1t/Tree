# Tree
[![Powershellgallery Badge][psgallery-badge]][psgallery-status]

List contents of directories in a tree-like format with colorization and lots of options.

I frequently need a tree-style directory listing charts to include in my `GitHub` doc files. But the native windows `tree.com` implementation is far from perfect, and the Linux clone `Tree for Windows` renders the tree with legacy `ASCII` characters.
So I decided to spend a couple of hours to write this wrapper with color highlighting and proper leafs rendering support.

> This module uses [Tree for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tree.htm) in order to get the initial directory structure and then colorizes its output and renders the unicode representation.

Make sure to download the [Tree for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tree.htm) and make it accessible through your system `PATH` variable
Install via Chocolatey: [`cinst tree`](https://chocolatey.org/packages/tree)

`Get-ChildItemTree` Understands all of its Linux `tree` counterpart, [command line switches](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree). So, feel free to read the official [docs](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree) for more info.

## Install
```powershell
PS> Install-Module Tree
```
> If you want the alias `tree` to work properly, add `Import-Module Tree` to your Powershell profile config.

Use `Get-ChildItemTree --help` for help.

- The path is optional
- Network paths supported `\\server.local\Path`

```powershell
# Generate the tree
# -a include hidden files
# -I exclude .git folder
PS>Get-ChildItemTree D:\Path -a -I .git
```
